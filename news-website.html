        <h2>High-stakes Senate primary tests Missouri Republicans' tolerance for an Eric Greitens return</h2>
        <p>Paula Callihan hasn't quite decided whom she's voting for in Tuesday's crowded GOP Senate primary.
           But she knows whom she's not voting for.</p>
        <h4>Voters' complicated relationship with Greitens</h4>
        <p>Temperatures lingering above 100 degrees didn't stop southwest Missouri's GOP faithful from setting up their lawn chairs Tuesday evening in Neosho to nibble on watermelon and hear two hours' worth of speeches from candidates up and down the ticket, although Hartzler and McCloskey were the only Senate contenders to show up.</p>
        <h4>Democrats vie for a chance at an uphill battle</h4>   
        <p>The selfie line after Marine veteran Lucas Kunce's 7 p.m. rally on Wednesday moved so slowly that it was dark by the time the last voters had left the outdoor amphitheater in Columbia.</p> 
        <h4>The threat of last-minute Trump involvement</h4>
        <p>While the politicians at the Watermelon Feed name-dropped Trump onstage, a life-size cardboard cutout of the former President was notably not front and center but tucked away next to the information tent, where filing out a "straw quiz" qualified you to win South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's book, a $10 Chick-fil-A gift card or .22 ammo.</p>

            <h2>Manchin says Republicans in 'normal times' would be supporting energy, health care bill</h2>

            <h2>Russia is recruiting thousands of volunteers to replenish its ranks in Ukraine. Prior experience isn't always required</h2>
            <p>Across Russia, volunteer battalions are being formed to deploy to the war in Ukraine, joining the so-called "special military operation" declared by President Vladimir Putin in February.</p>
            <h4>Patriotism -- and cash</h4>
            <p>Stepanenko says the process is being driven from Moscow. "The Kremlin reportedly ordered all 85 Russian federal subjects (regions of the Russian Federation plus occupied Crimea and Sevastopol) to recruit volunteer battalions to avoid declaring partial or full mobilization in Russia."</p>
